## With Guest Speaker: Doug Stephens, Founder & CEO, Retail Prophet


#### Priyanka talks to Doug Stephens, Founder and CEO of Retail Prophet, the consultancy Doug founded almost 10 years ago. Doug has spent over 25 years in the retail industry and is one of the world’s foremost retail industry futurists. Safe to say, retail is now completely different to what it used to be when Doug started out. In huge part thanks to eCommerce!

His unique perspectives on retailing, business and consumer behavior have been featured in many of the world’s leading publications like the The New York Times, BBC, Bloomberg Business, TechCrunch, Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal and Fast Company.


I am going to be talking to Doug about surprising developments in retail over the years, how the role of the stores is changing, which technologies are transforming supply chain, how a retailer can keep up with customer behaviour and how has the retail organizational set up changed over the years as a result of “omnichannel”.
