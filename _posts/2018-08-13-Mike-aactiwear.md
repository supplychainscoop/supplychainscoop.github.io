#### Questions Mike answered
- How can a brand differentiate itself and find its USP?
- You’ve held so many positions at various retail companies.. What are the biggest pros and cons of working in small companies vs large companies in a marketing and supply chain context?
- Since you’ve been CEO of multiple organizations you have seen how organizational set ups have transformed over the years. De-siloing is absolutely the need of the hour – no two ways about that. But practically speaking, how can marketing, merchandizing and supply chain teams work together towards a common goal? What’s the biggest hurdle stopping them now?
- You created an impressive dropship network at eBags. What are the key aspects for an effective dropship programme?
- What are some of the key trends that will pan out over the next 5 years in retail?
- Which technologies will have a transformative effect on the retail industry?
- Who do you look up to in the retail industry (individual or company) and why?
